# Kids' Schedule Organizer

This personal project is all about enhancing my React skills while building a practical tool for organizing daily activities for children. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that helps parents and caregivers easily manage their kids' schedules.

With features like adding, deleting, and marking activities as done, along with fun animated icons for morning, afternoon, and evening tasks, this app aims to make scheduling both efficient and enjoyable. Plus, I've prioritized accessibility and a mobile-first design to ensure a great experience for all users.
